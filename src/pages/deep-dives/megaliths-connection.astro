        <p class="lead">
          Between 4500 BCE and 1500 BCE, cultures across the world—with no known contact—began erecting massive stone monuments. From the standing stones of Brittany to the dolmens of Korea, from Stonehenge to the moai of Easter Island, humanity seemed seized by a simultaneous urge to move impossibly heavy stones.
        </p>

        <h2>The Global Distribution</h2>
        <p>
          The megalithic phenomenon spans six continents. Consider the timeline:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Malta (3600-2500 BCE):</strong> Ġgantija temples, among the oldest freestanding structures on Earth</li>
          <li><strong>France (4500-2000 BCE):</strong> Carnac alignments with over 3,000 standing stones</li>
          <li><strong>Britain/Ireland (3200-2000 BCE):</strong> Stonehenge, Newgrange, Avebury</li>
          <li><strong>Korea (1500-300 BCE):</strong> 40% of the world's dolmens—over 35,000</li>
          <li><strong>Easter Island (1000-1600 CE):</strong> Nearly 1,000 moai statues</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These cultures used different techniques, worshipped different gods, and had no means of transatlantic communication. Yet they all developed the same obsession: moving stones too heavy to move.
        </p>

        <h2>The Conventional Explanation</h2>
        <p>
          Mainstream archaeology explains this through "parallel evolution"—the idea that similar environments produce similar solutions. Stone is durable. Ancestors deserve permanent monuments. Astronomical knowledge requires fixed observation points. Different cultures, facing similar needs, independently arrived at similar solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This explanation has merit. Agricultural societies worldwide developed similar pottery, similar tools, similar social hierarchies. Why not similar monuments?
        </p>

        <h2>The Uncomfortable Coincidences</h2>
        <p>
          But some details are harder to explain through coincidence alone:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Astronomical alignments:</strong> Stonehenge, Newgrange, Angkor Wat, and numerous other sites align precisely to solstices or equinoxes. Different cultures, same celestial obsession.</li>
          <li><strong>Stone selection:</strong> Many megalithic cultures transported specific stone types over enormous distances—Welsh bluestone to Stonehenge, Scottish stone to Stonehenge's altar. Why not use local stone?</li>
          <li><strong>Acoustic properties:</strong> Multiple megalithic sites show evidence of acoustic engineering—sound amplification, echo effects, resonance chambers.</li>
          <li><strong>"Flying stones" legends:</strong> From Easter Island to Egypt to Britain, local legends describe stones that flew or floated into position through magic or divine intervention.</li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"The global distribution of megalithic architecture raises questions that parallel evolution alone cannot answer. Either these cultures shared knowledge through unknown channels, or they independently discovered the same architectural principles—which itself requires explanation."</p>
          <cite>— Dr. Michael Parker Pearson, University College London</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>The Diffusion Hypothesis</h2>
        <p>
          Some researchers propose that megalithic knowledge spread from a single source—a "mother culture" that dispersed architectural knowledge worldwide. Candidates include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Maritime diffusion:</strong> Seafaring cultures spreading knowledge along coastal routes</li>
          <li><strong>Sundaland hypothesis:</strong> A lost civilization on the submerged landmass connecting Southeast Asia</li>
          <li><strong>Pre-flood civilization:</strong> Graham Hancock's proposed global maritime culture destroyed by rising seas after the Ice Age</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These theories remain controversial. The main objection: where's the evidence of contact? No Egyptian artifacts in Peru, no Chinese pottery in Britain, no smoking gun of ancient globalization.
        </p>

        <h2>The Genetic Evidence</h2>
        <p>
          Recent DNA studies have revealed surprising connections. The builders of Stonehenge were genetically distinct from earlier British populations—migrants from the Mediterranean who arrived around 3000 BCE, bringing new technologies and beliefs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similar genetic transitions occurred across Europe during the megalithic era. New populations didn't just bring new genes—they brought new ideas. Could megalithic knowledge have traveled with these migrations?
        </p>

        <h2>The Shared Symbolism</h2>
        <p>
          Perhaps most intriguing are the symbolic parallels:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Spiral carvings appear at Newgrange (Ireland), Gavrinis (France), and numerous American sites</li>
          <li>Cup-and-ring marks are found from Scotland to India to Mexico</li>
          <li>The "plumed serpent" motif appears in both Mesoamerica and ancient Mediterranean cultures</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Skeptics argue these are simple geometric forms that any culture might discover. Believers see evidence of shared tradition.
        </p>

        <h2>What We Can Say</h2>
        <p>
          The honest answer is: we don't know. The evidence supports multiple interpretations:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Pure coincidence:</strong> Similar needs produced similar monuments independently</li>
          <li><strong>Limited contact:</strong> Some knowledge spread through trade routes we haven't fully mapped</li>
          <li><strong>Lost knowledge:</strong> A pre-Ice Age culture spread ideas that survived in fragmented form</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          What's certain is that the megalithic impulse was universal. Something in human nature, in our relationship with stone and sky and ancestors, drove cultures worldwide to move mountains—literally. Whether they learned from each other or discovered the same truths independently, the result was the same: monuments that still stand, still inspire, and still refuse to reveal their secrets.
