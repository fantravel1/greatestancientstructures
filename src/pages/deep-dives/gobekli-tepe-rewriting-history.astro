          How Göbekli Tepe Rewrote Human History
        </h1>

        <p class="text-xl text-stone-400 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          For decades, archaeology told us a simple story: humans invented agriculture,
          settled down, built villages, and <em>then</em> developed religion. Göbekli Tepe
          shattered that narrative completely.

          The Discovery That Changed Everything
        </h2>

        <p class="text-stone-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          In 1994, German archaeologist Klaus Schmidt arrived at a hill in southeastern Turkey
          that locals called "Potbelly Hill" (Göbekli Tepe). What he found would overturn a
          century of archaeological assumptions.
        </p>

        <p class="text-stone-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Beneath the surface lay massive T-shaped limestone pillars arranged in circles,
          decorated with intricate carvings of animals—foxes, lions, scorpions, vultures,
          and snakes. Carbon dating revealed the unthinkable: <strong class="text-gold-400">these
          structures were 12,000 years old</strong>, built around 9500 BCE.
        </p>

        <div class="card p-6 my-8 border-l-4 border-gold-400">
          <p class="text-lg text-stone-200 italic mb-2">
            "First came the temple, then the city."
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-stone-500">— Klaus Schmidt, lead archaeologist</p>
        </div>

        <p class="text-stone-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          This predates Stonehenge by 6,000 years. It predates the pyramids by 7,000 years.
          Most shocking: it predates agriculture itself. The people who built Göbekli Tepe
          were hunter-gatherers who hadn't yet learned to farm.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p class="text-stone-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Here's what makes Göbekli Tepe truly baffling: there's no evidence anyone
          lived there. No houses. No trash middens. No cooking areas. This wasn't a
          settlement—it was a destination.
        </p>

        <p class="text-stone-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Hunter-gatherer bands from across the region traveled here to construct and
          worship at these temples. They quarried limestone pillars weighing up to 50 tons,
          transported them hundreds of meters, carved them with sophisticated reliefs,
          and erected them in precise circles—all without metal tools, wheels, or beasts of burden.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-stone-100 mt-12 mb-6">
          Why Religion Came First
        </h2>

        <p class="text-stone-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The old model said agriculture freed humans from constant food-seeking, giving them
          time to develop complex societies and beliefs. Göbekli Tepe suggests the opposite:
          <strong class="text-gold-400">religion may have driven the invention of agriculture</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="text-stone-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Think about it: building and maintaining Göbekli Tepe required organizing hundreds of
          people over generations. It required surplus food to feed workers who weren't hunting.
          It required social structures to coordinate labor.
        </p>

        <p class="text-stone-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The pressure to support this religious project may have pushed humans to domesticate
          plants and animals. Wild wheat and barley were first cultivated within 30 kilometers
          of Göbekli Tepe. This might not be coincidence—it might be causation.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-stone-100 mt-12 mb-6">
          The Deliberate Burial Mystery
        </h2>

        <p class="text-stone-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Around 8000 BCE, something extraordinary happened: the builders of Göbekli Tepe
          deliberately buried the entire site under tons of soil and debris. They didn't
          abandon it—they <em>entombed</em> it.
        </p>

        <p class="text-stone-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Why? We don't know. But this burial preserved the site in remarkable condition,
          protecting the carvings from millennia of erosion. Without it, we might never
          have known these temples existed.

          The Taş Tepeler Revolution
        </h2>

        <p class="text-stone-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Göbekli Tepe is no longer unique. Since its discovery, archaeologists have found
          a network of at least 12 similar sites in the region, collectively called
          <strong class="text-gold-400">Taş Tepeler</strong> ("Stone Hills").
        </p>

        <p class="text-stone-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Karahan Tepe, opened to the public in 2023, may be even older. Its pillars are
          carved directly from the bedrock, and its imagery shifts from animals to humans—
          including haunting human heads carved into the walls.
        </p>

        <p class="text-stone-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          These sites suggest a sophisticated, interconnected Neolithic society that we
          never imagined existed. The "primitive hunter-gatherers" of 12,000 years ago
          were capable of monumental architecture, advanced planning, and organized labor
          on a scale we're only beginning to understand.

          What We Still Don't Know
        </h2>

        <p class="text-stone-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          With only 10% of Göbekli Tepe excavated, the site holds countless secrets:

          The Bigger Picture
        </h2>

        <p class="text-stone-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Göbekli Tepe reminds us that human history is deeper and more complex than textbooks
          suggest. For every discovery like this, there may be dozens more buried under
          millennia of sediment, waiting to rewrite history again.
        </p>

        <p class="text-stone-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The site stands as a monument not just to ancient beliefs, but to human capability.
          Twelve thousand years ago, without any of our technology, our ancestors achieved
          something that still inspires awe. What else might we have forgotten?
