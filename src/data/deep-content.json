      "introduction": "Göbekli Tepe fundamentally changed our understanding of human prehistory. Discovered in 1994 by German archaeologist Klaus Schmidt, this 12,000-year-old temple complex predates agriculture, pottery, and even the wheel. Its existence proves that organized religion and monumental architecture emerged before—not because of—settled farming life.",

          "content": "At 9500 BCE, Göbekli Tepe predates the earliest known pottery by 1,500 years, the wheel by 5,000 years, and Stonehenge by 6,000 years. The site was built by hunter-gatherers who had no permanent settlements, no domesticated animals, and no metal tools. Yet they carved, transported, and erected limestone pillars weighing up to 50 tons."

          "content": "Perhaps most baffling: there's no evidence anyone lived at Göbekli Tepe. No houses, no cooking areas, no water sources. This was a pilgrimage site where nomadic bands gathered periodically for construction and ritual. The logistics of feeding hundreds of workers without agriculture remains one of archaeology's greatest puzzles."
