      "introduction": "Göbekli Tepe fundamentally changed our understanding of human prehistory. Discovered in 1994 by German archaeologist Klaus Schmidt, this 12,000-year-old temple complex predates agriculture, pottery, and even the wheel. Its existence proves that organized religion and monumental architecture emerged before—not because of—settled farming life.",

          "content": "At 9500 BCE, Göbekli Tepe predates the earliest known pottery by 1,500 years, the wheel by 5,000 years, and Stonehenge by 6,000 years. The site was built by hunter-gatherers who had no permanent settlements, no domesticated animals, and no metal tools. Yet they carved, transported, and erected limestone pillars weighing up to 50 tons."

          "content": "Perhaps most baffling: there's no evidence anyone lived at Göbekli Tepe. No houses, no cooking areas, no water sources. This was a pilgrimage site where nomadic bands gathered periodically for construction and ritual. The logistics of feeding hundreds of workers without agriculture remains one of archaeology's greatest puzzles."

      "introduction": "On the tiny island of Gozo, Malta's Ġgantija temples predate the Egyptian pyramids by 1,000 years. Built between 3600-3200 BCE, these are among Earth's oldest freestanding structures—constructed by a civilization that left no written records and vanished mysteriously around 2500 BCE.",

          "title": "Before the Pyramids",
          "content": "Ġgantija (meaning 'Giant's Tower') was built when the Sahara was still green and mammoths roamed Siberia. Using only obsidian tools and limestone, the temple builders created structures with stones weighing up to 50 tons. These Maltese temples represent humanity's first large-scale monumental architecture."

          "title": "The Temple People",
          "content": "Malta's temple-building culture lasted 1,100 years, constructing at least 30 major temples across the islands. Then, around 2500 BCE, they vanished—replaced by a completely different Bronze Age culture. No warfare evidence exists. Climate change, disease, or social collapse? The disappearance remains one of Mediterranean prehistory's great mysteries."

          "title": "Fat Lady Figurines",
          "content": "The temple culture left hundreds of distinctive 'fat lady' figurines—stylized figures with massive lower bodies and tiny heads. These may represent a mother goddess, fertility symbols, or something else entirely. Similar imagery appears across all Maltese temples, suggesting a unified religious tradition."
